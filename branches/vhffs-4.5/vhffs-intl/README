Add a new language
==================

Initialize the new po file:
msginit -l LL_CC
Where LL is your language code and CC your country code (fr_CA, en_GB, ...).

Translate the file LL_CC.po.
Add your language code to LINGUAS, make make install.
If you make a full translation you can add your language to the default
available languages in vhffs-backend/conf/vhffs.conf.dist.in.

Update all translation files
============================

Run update-POFILES.in.sh, this will update POFILES.in (list of files containing
translated strings) and update the translations.
