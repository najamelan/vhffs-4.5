=head1 NAME

Vhffs::ObjectFactory - Factory for VHFFS Objects.

=head1 SYNOPSYS

This class can be used to fetch a full object without any knowledge of its
type. This way, we can use polymorphism.

=head1 METHODS

=cut

package Vhffs::ObjectFactory;

use strict;
use utf8;
use Vhffs::Constants;
use Vhffs::Functions;
use Vhffs::User;
use Vhffs::Group;
use Vhffs::Services;
use Vhffs::Object;

=head2 fetch_object

	my $obj = Vhffs::ObjectFactory::fetch_object($vhffs, $oid);

Returns the object whose oid is C<$oid>. Actually the returned entity is a
subclass of Vhffs::Object, allowing use of polymorphism (eg. calling get_label
will call the subcall get_label method).

=cut
sub fetch_object {
	my ($vhffs, $oid) = @_;
	my $obj = Vhffs::Object::get_by_oid($vhffs, $oid);
	return undef unless defined $obj;
	my $class = Vhffs::Functions::type_class_from_type_id($obj->get_type);
	$obj = $class->fill_object($obj) if defined $class;
	return $obj;
}

return 1;
